This is a learning project for ReactNative with TypeScript. I am testing different possibilities and tools which are available with Visual Studio Code. 

My main focus is to 
----------
- Fix all issues regarding TypeScript
- Find a solution for TypeScript Intellisense
- Automate build deployment etc

If you are interested in this you can also contribute.

Thanks
